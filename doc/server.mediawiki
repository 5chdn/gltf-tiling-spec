==Abstract==

Different approaches for styling and rendering maps in web applications exist.
Widely used architectures are raster or vector services that provide web mapping
apps with geodata in client/server models. Raster data is efficiently
prerendered server-side using a static, predefined appearance. Vector data can be
rendered client-side using dynamic stylization with CPU-consuming JavaScript
postprocessing algorithms.

In the light of powerful, dedicated graphics hardware being even available on
mobile devices nowadays, this specification suggests new techniques for client-side
rendering of web maps with complex geometries on GPUs. This technique allows to
display complex geodata and maintain a dynamic, interactive styling while
preserving real-time rendering performance and low response times.

This part of the specification describes the server sided preprocessing of
the geodata, tiling logic and array buffer creation for vertices, indices and
colours.

==Motivation==

Rendering huge geodata sets in web-based applications remains a performance
critical task due to the complexity of the underlying data. Using classic
approaches to render geodata in a web browser either leaves users with a
predefined, static style (raster data) or a notable computation-intense
rendering process (vector data).

The two aforementioned solutions of styling and rendering web maps are widely
established and have proven effective. But both approaches have certain
drawbacks.

====Raster Tiles====

Data transmitted in prerendered '''raster''' data formats (e.g., png, jpg) does
not require any client-side processing and can be compressed and cached easily.
This is used by major web mapping services like Google or Bing maps. The
disadvantage for interactive mapping solutions is the lack of possibilities for
users to dynamically interact with the map and retrieve custom styles at
runtime without requesting a full map tile reload. Web services using this
technology solve this with tiny vector overlays displaying additional
user-styled information. But it is not possible to interact with the map data
itself.

====Vector Tiles====

Geodata transmitted in '''vector''' formats (e.g., json, gml) opposes the raster
tile approach and allows client-side stylization and rendering as the geographic
raw data suddenly becomes available for the browser. But this advantage of
options utilizing the geodata in the client comes with a major drawback in
performance. Both the processing of the data and the rendering for the user are
solved with CPU-consuming JavaScript algorithms. Some more recent solutions
offer GPU-based rendering but fail with supplying convenient solutions of pre-
or postprocessing of the vector data. Performance bottlenecks are avoided by
filtering the data on the backend side.

====Challenge====

The challenge now is twofold interesting. On the one hand it is important to
enable rendering using GPU-based techniques like
[[https://khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest|WebGL]]. This allows dynamic,
interactive and user-defined styles to be rendered directly on the client's
device. But on the other hand it is a must to completely eliminate the
client-side postprocessing of the geodata as this becomes a major performance
bottleneck with increasing data complexity.

The solution presented in this work is a hardware-'''geometry'''-based approach rather
than known vector- or raster-based solutions. It maintains the goal to allow
real-time rendering with outstanding performance and very low response times for
the client.

The term 'geometry' may also refer to the missing geometry shader stage in WebGL
as of version 1.0 which is bypassed with this technology. Future releases of
WebGL might render this solution obsolete.

==Specification==

This is the technical specification for '''glTF tiling''', especially the backend
server sided preprocessing of the data and the API design.

===Map Tiling Logic===

glTF tiles are subdivided using common quadtree logic, similar to known
raster or vector tiling services. The tiles get <code>{z, x, y}</code>
coordinates similar to the
[[http://www.maptiler.org/google-maps-coordinates-tile-bounds-projection/|Google Maps]]
style, where <code>z</code> is the zoom and <code>x, y</code> the position
on the flat, quadratic web-mercator worldmap.

====Zoom====

There are <code>22</code> zoom levels by default. Level <code>0</code>
contains only one quadratic tile containing the whole world map on
<code>{0, 0, 0}</code>. Level <code>21</code> contains 4,398,046,511,104
(<code>4^21</code>) tiles where the world's boundaries are
<code>{21, 0, 0}</code>, <code>{21, 2097151, 0}</code>,
<code>{21, 0, 2097151}</code> and <code>{21, 2097151, 2097151}</code>.

Additional zoom levels are not considered to be practicable but can easily
added to the tiling logic following the <code>4^n</code> quadtree. The
defined number of zoom levels is not considired a binding boundary but
rather a recommended minimum to align with existing solutions.

====Coordinates====

The point of origin of the tile coordinates is the northwest corner of
the map <code>{z, 0, 0}</code>. All <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
coordinates are positive integers. <code>x</code> increases along the
equatorial axis from west to east. <code>y</code> increases along the
meridianal axis from north to south.

<code>z</code> is not considered to be a third dimension but rather the
current zoom level. Three dimensional data is not covered by this
specification and sould be flattened.

====Generalization====

Generalization or general simplificatoin of complex geodata sets is not
part of this specificatoin. In opposite: this technology should be agnostic
to the complexity of the underlying data.

===Projections===

To minimize the processing of data and allow easy OpenGL-transformations, it’s
important to reduce reprojections and avoid spherical units (e.g., degree,
latitude/longitude).

====World Geodetic System====

Most webmapping applications use the <code>EPSG:4326</code> standard projection
which is the world geodetic system 1984 (WGS84) and uses a latitude/longitude
coordinate format. This means, most programming interfaces return values in
degree.

====Web Mercator====

Internally, many apps use <code>EPSG:3857</code>, the web mercator projection,
a metric system going back to Gerard Mercator’s
[[http://ideas.time.com/2013/11/21/a-history-of-the-world-in-twelve-maps/slide/gerard-mercator-world-map-1569/|flat world map]]
in 1569. It uses northing and easting as a measure of distance in meters from
the equator and the prime meridian. This is already an advantage over WGS84 as
it does not require computing-intense spheric transformations in calculations.

====Normalized Mercator====

To simplify the geographic coordinates, all geographic references will be
normalized on a single scale between [0, 1] with it’s origin in the
northwest corner.

=====Coordinates=====

This pixel projection origin initializes with <code>x=0.0</code> and
<code>y=0.0</code> in the northwest corner of the map. The maximum boundary
is <code>x=1.0</code> and <code>y=1.0</code> in the southeast corner.
In this reference system, for instance the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin would
be at normalized mercator coordinate <code>{0.5371583, 0.3279734}</code>.

===Transfer Formats===

Due to the data-intense applications in webmapping services, most
implementations follow a client/server model. It’s important to research and
evaluate options on exchange formats for the underlying geodata.

The following formats are considered worth for comparison.

* In computer graphics, the COLLADA digital asset exchange format (<code>.dae</code>) is used for modelling purposes and exchange of editable 3D models.
* The new OpenGL transfer fromat (<code>.gltf</code>) was recently released by the Khronos Group and promises to be a file format more close to the hardware requirements.
* In geoinformation sciences, GeoJSON is a JavaScript object notation (<code>.json</code>) which is extended by geographic features with geometries and properties.
* The Geography Markup Language (<code>.gml</code>) is an XML grammar for expressing geographical features.

Formats not taken into account are KML, Google’s equivalent to GML, and
TopoJSON, another JSON format with merged geometry fields. In addition, raster
data formats are ignored as they do not store any extractable geometry
information.

The table below compares the stated formats and evaluates both, their
space-complexity and postprocessing requirements. The space-complexity is
important to evaluate the required bandwidth for the application. The
postprocessing is the aforementioned bottleneck in performance of transforming
geographic data into close-to-hardware array buffers for the GPUs.

|}

Concerning the space requirements, both glTF and COLLADA perform above average.
Base of the comparison are the Cesium Milk Truck and Cesium Man by
[[https://github.com/5chdn/gltf-tiling-spec/tree/gh-pages/dat/cesium|Analytical Graphics Inc]].
The binary version of glTF (<code>.glb</code>) is even smaller than a gzipped
version (<code>.gltf.gz</code>). Classic geodata formats fail in terms of
space-complexity since both, JSON and XML formats are quite bloated.

Concerning the client-side postprocessing requirements, only the OpenGL transfer
format allows to store array buffers which eleminates any javascript processing
other than requesting and reading the data. This is an obvious knockout criteria
for the other candidates and therefore glTF will be considered the best choice
for this application.

===WebGL Buffer Logic===

To render multiple line primitives in a single WebGL draw call it's recommended
to pass both vertex and index buffers to the graphic processing unit. The
following table displays a test data set of several edges in the center of
Berlin with indices, x-coordinates, and y-coordinates.

====Vertex Buffers====

The vertex buffers
[[http://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/q/2303/361|usually only hold coordinates]]
(X, Y). The vertex buffer size (or dimension) is therefore two. It's recommended
to eliminate duplicate entries to reduce the size of the dataset. Multiple
references to the same vertex are realized with pointing indices in the
according sequence to the first occurence of the coordinates in the vertex
buffer.

<code>
"vertexSize": 2,
"vertices": [
  0.537167191505432, 0.327970743179321,
  0.537165760993958, 0.327970921993256,
  0.537165939807892, 0.327972143888473,
  0.537167310714722, 0.327972024679184,
  0.537164211273193, 0.327973991632462,
  0.537165582180023, 0.327973812818527
]
</code>

====Index Buffers====

The index buffer contains information about which lines to draw between the
vertices. It uses the index of each vertex in the vertex buffer as a value.

The following index buffer draws three separated lines. The
[[http://www.tutorialspoint.com/webgl/webgl_modes_of_drawing.htm|gl.LINES mode]]
always draws one unconnected line segment between two vertices as specified in
the index buffer.

<code>
"drawMode": "LINES",
"indexSize": 1,
"indices": [
  0,
  1,
  2,
  3,
  4,
  5
]
</code>

The following screenshot shows the rendered output of the example vertex and
index buffers as specified above.

====Additional Buffers====

Additional buffers can be added to the scene at will. They could encode anything
from color buffers directly supplying the lines with colors to meta information
like line types, or in this specific case of encuding street geometries:
[[wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features||map feature classes]].

The final result after realizing this specification could look like the
following screenshot. Here are travel times directly encoded in an additional
color buffer.
